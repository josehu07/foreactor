# Description: Implementation of the --no-overwrite-dir option was flawed in
# tar versions up to 1.32.90.  This option is intended to preserve metadata
# of existing directories.  In fact it worked only for non-empty directories.
# Moreover, if the actual directory was owned by the user tar runs as and the
# S_IWUSR bit was not set in its actual permissions, tar failed to create files
# in it.
