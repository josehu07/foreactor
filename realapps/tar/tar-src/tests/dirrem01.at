# Description:
#
# When a directory in a deep directory disappeared during creation
# of incremental dump, tar <= 1.29 exits with TAREXIT_FAILURE (2).
#
# In case of files tar does not return TAREXIT_FAILURE, but instead
# it prints a warning and exits with TAREXIT_DIFFERS.
#
# This test checks whether this behaviour is mimicked for directories, too.
#
# Notes:
#   1. This file is based on 'filerem01.at', which is the test-case for
#   a vanishing file.
#   2. Depending on the stat.st_ctime resolution, the "file changed as we
#   read it" warning might be issued for dir/sub. The test takes care to
#   suppress it.
