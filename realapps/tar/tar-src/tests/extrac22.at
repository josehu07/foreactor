AT_SETUP([delay-directory-restore on reversed ordering])

# The --delay-directory-resore option worked incorrectly on archives with
# reversed member ordering (which was documented, anyway). This is illustrated
# in
#   http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2019-03/msg00022.html
# which was taken as a base for this testcase.
# The bug affected tar versions <= 1.32.
