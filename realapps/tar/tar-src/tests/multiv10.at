# Description: When creating multivolume archives, the bufmap code in
# buffer.c implicitly assumed that the members are stored in the archive
# in a contiguous fashion, ignoring the member (and eventual extended) headers
# between them.  This worked until the member header happened to be at
# the very beginning of the volume, in which case its length was included in
# the calculation of the stored size and size left to store.  Due to this,
# the GNUFileParts extended header contained invalid GNU.volume.offset value,
# and the resulting archive failed to extract properly.  The bug affected
# versions of tar up to 1.29.90 (commit da8d0659a6).
#
# This test case also checks that GNUFileParts headers are not displayed in
# verbose mode.
