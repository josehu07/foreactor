# When called with the --delay-directory-restore option, tar would
# in some cases restore the directory permissions too early, before
# attempting to replace softlink placeholders with the actual link.
# This caused failure if the permissions forbade writing.
#
# The bug was caused by incorrect assumption about delayed_set_stat
# ordering in create_placeholder_file.
