.SH NAME
cksum \- compute and verify file checksums
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cksum
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]... [\fI\,FILE\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Print or verify checksums.
By default use the 32 bit CRC algorithm.
.PP
With no FILE, or when FILE is \-, read standard input.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-algorithm\fR=\fI\,TYPE\/\fR
select the digest type to use.  See DIGEST below.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
read checksums from the FILEs and check them
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-length\fR=\fI\,BITS\/\fR
digest length in bits; must not exceed the max for
the blake2 algorithm and must be a multiple of 8
.TP
\fB\-\-tag\fR
create a BSD\-style checksum (the default)
.TP
\fB\-\-untagged\fR
create a reversed style checksum, without digest type
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
end each output line with NUL, not newline,
and disable file name escaping
.SS "The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:"
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-missing\fR
don't fail or report status for missing files
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
don't print OK for each successfully verified file
.TP
\fB\-\-status\fR
don't output anything, status code shows success
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
exit non\-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-warn\fR
warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
indicate which implementation used
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.SS "DIGEST determines the digest algorithm and default output format:"
