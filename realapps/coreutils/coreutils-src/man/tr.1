.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tr
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]... \fI\,STRING1 \/\fR[\fI\,STRING2\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input,
writing to standard output.  STRING1 and STRING2 specify arrays of
characters ARRAY1 and ARRAY2 that control the action.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-complement\fR
use the complement of ARRAY1
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delete\fR
delete characters in ARRAY1, do not translate
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-squeeze\-repeats\fR
replace each sequence of a repeated character
that is listed in the last specified ARRAY,
with a single occurrence of that character
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-truncate\-set1\fR
first truncate ARRAY1 to length of ARRAY2
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
ARRAYs are specified as strings of characters.  Most represent themselves.
Interpreted sequences are:
.TP
\eNNN
character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)
.TP
\e\e
backslash
.TP
\ea
audible BEL
.TP
\eb
backspace
.TP
\ef
form feed
.TP
\en
new line
.TP
\er
return
.TP
\et
horizontal tab
.TP
\ev
vertical tab
.TP
CHAR1\-CHAR2
all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order
.TP
[CHAR*]
in ARRAY2, copies of CHAR until length of ARRAY1
.TP
[CHAR*REPEAT]
REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting with 0
.TP
[:alnum:]
all letters and digits
.TP
[:alpha:]
all letters
.TP
[:blank:]
all horizontal whitespace
.TP
[:cntrl:]
all control characters
.TP
[:digit:]
all digits
.TP
[:graph:]
all printable characters, not including space
.TP
[:lower:]
all lower case letters
.TP
[:print:]
all printable characters, including space
.TP
[:punct:]
all punctuation characters
.TP
[:space:]
all horizontal or vertical whitespace
.TP
[:upper:]
all upper case letters
.TP
[:xdigit:]
all hexadecimal digits
.TP
[=CHAR=]
all characters which are equivalent to CHAR
.PP
Translation occurs if \fB\-d\fR is not given and both STRING1 and STRING2 appear.
\fB\-t\fR may be used only when translating.  ARRAY2 is extended to length of
ARRAY1 by repeating its last character as necessary.  Excess characters
of ARRAY2 are ignored.  Character classes expand in unspecified order;
while translating, [:lower:] and [:upper:] may be used in pairs to
specify case conversion.  Squeezing occurs after translation or deletion.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Full support is available only for safe single-byte locales,
in which every possible input byte represents a single character.
The C locale is safe in GNU systems, so you can avoid this issue
in the shell by running
.B "LC_ALL=C tr"
instead of plain
.BR tr .
